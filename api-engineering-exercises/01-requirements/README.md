# Project 01 - API Requirements

If a syntax item is unfamiliar, use the local quick reference in this track. It contains syntax examples and helper notes without solving this project.

## What You Are Learning

- a good API starts as a contract, not code
- the client, the resource, and the response all need to be named
- the brief should be written in observable terms

## Beginner Bridge

Start from a plain HTTP handler or request struct. Then add the new contract rule only where it is needed.

### Before
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("write the contract, then the handler")
}
```

### After
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func helper() string {
    return "write the request and response contract first"
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(helper())
}
```

## Worked Example

Use the same pattern in a different domain first. The names are different. The structure is the part to copy.

### Example code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("GET /accounts/{id} returns the account summary")
}
```

### Expected output
```text
GET /accounts/{id} returns the account summary
```

### Transfer the pattern, not the names

| In the example | In this exercise |
|---|---|
| contract | states what the client can rely on |
| resource | names the thing |
| response | describes what comes back |

## Design / Reasoning Before Syntax

1. Write the request the client sends.
2. Write the response the client should observe.
3. Choose the boundary checks that protect the handler.
4. Decide which status code describes each outcome.
5. Keep the contract and the code in lockstep.

This is the proof path. The code should match it instead of inventing a new shape after the fact.

## Your Program / Tasks

1. Describe the contract, then make the HTTP shape match it.
2. Write the observable request and response first.
3. Keep transport details separate from the business meaning.

## Build In Checkpoints

1. Name the resource and the action before writing the handler.
2. Choose the status code and response shape before the implementation.
3. Add one success path and one failure path.
4. Check that the boundary behavior matches the contract exactly.

## Failure Drills

1. Return 200 for everything. Why: the client cannot tell success from failure.
2. Blend validation, auth, and storage together. Why: the contract becomes unreadable.
3. Hide a breaking change inside the path or body. Why: old clients will fail with no warning.

## You Understand This When / Done Means

- Can you state the contract in one sentence?
- Can you point to the exact method, status, or field that proves each branch?
- Can you explain why a client would trust this API shape?
