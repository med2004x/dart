# Project 15 - API Engineering Capstone

If a syntax item is unfamiliar, use the local quick reference in this track. It contains syntax examples and helper notes without solving this project.

## What You Are Learning

- the capstone combines contracts, validation, auth, jobs, and versioning
- the API should be understandable from the outside first
- every status code and error shape should serve the client

## Beginner Bridge

Start from a plain HTTP handler or request struct. Then add the new contract rule only where it is needed.

### Before
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("write the contract, then the handler")
}
```

### After
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func helper() string {
    return "combine contract, validation, auth, and jobs"
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(helper())
}
```

## Worked Example

Use the same pattern in a different domain first. The names are different. The structure is the part to copy.

### Example code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("combine contract, validation, auth, and async work")
}
```

### Expected output
```text
combine contract, validation, auth, and async work
```

### Transfer the pattern, not the names

| In the example | In this exercise |
|---|---|
| contract | defines the API |
| validation | guards the boundary |
| async work | handles slow jobs |

## Design / Reasoning Before Syntax

1. Write the request the client sends.
2. Write the response the client should observe.
3. Choose the boundary checks that protect the handler.
4. Decide which status code describes each outcome.
5. Keep the contract and the code in lockstep.

This is the proof path. The code should match it instead of inventing a new shape after the fact.

## Your Program / Tasks

1. Describe the contract, then make the HTTP shape match it.
2. Write the observable request and response first.
3. Keep transport details separate from the business meaning.

## Build In Checkpoints

1. Name the resource and the action before writing the handler.
2. Choose the status code and response shape before the implementation.
3. Add one success path and one failure path.
4. Check that the boundary behavior matches the contract exactly.

## Failure Drills

1. Return 200 for everything. Why: the client cannot tell success from failure.
2. Blend validation, auth, and storage together. Why: the contract becomes unreadable.
3. Hide a breaking change inside the path or body. Why: old clients will fail with no warning.

## You Understand This When / Done Means

- Can you state the contract in one sentence?
- Can you point to the exact method, status, or field that proves each branch?
- Can you explain why a client would trust this API shape?
